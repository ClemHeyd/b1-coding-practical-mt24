\section{Overview}
This project involves the development of a simulation framework for an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) mission. The primary goal is to model the trajectory of a submarine as it navigates through underwater environments, taking into account various disturbances and mission parameters.

\section{Key Components}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Classes}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Trajectory}: Responsible for storing and plotting the trajectory of the submarine during its mission.
        \item \textbf{Mission}: Represents a mission with reference points, cave heights, and depths. It includes methods for generating random missions and loading missions from CSV files.
        \item \textbf{ClosedLoop}: Implements a closed-loop control system for the submarine, simulating its behavior over a specified mission duration while accounting for disturbances.
        \item \textbf{Controller}: A simple proportional-derivative (PD) controller that computes actions based on the difference between observed and reference values.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Functionality}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The simulation can handle random disturbances, allowing for a more realistic representation of underwater conditions.
        \item The trajectory of the submarine is plotted against the mission parameters, providing visual feedback on its performance.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Handling}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The project includes functionality to read mission parameters from CSV files, facilitating easy updates and modifications to mission data.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
This project lays the groundwork for further enhancements, such as integrating more complex control algorithms, improving the disturbance modeling, and expanding the visualization capabilities. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for simulating UUV missions in various underwater scenarios.
